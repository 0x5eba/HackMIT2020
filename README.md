People have the power to build communities, meet other people from all around the world in video-chat, and the possibility to understand them even if they speak different languages

## IBM

I used Watson API to do speech-to-text of the conversation during the meeting, and then all the transcripts are translated to the language that you are speaking

## Facebook

Everyone can join or create a community with just a click, and meet a lot of new people with the same interest as you in a funny video-chat
